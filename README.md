After you have successfully installed the package (if you have not yet installed, please refer to [Installation](#installation)), use 'node server.js' to run the application in the terminal. 

When I start the application then, I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role. When I choose to view all departments then, I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids. When I choose to view all roles then, I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role. When I choose to view all employees then, I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to. When I choose to add a department then, I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database. When I choose to add a role then, I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database. When I choose to add an employee then, I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database. When I choose to update an employee role then, I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database.
